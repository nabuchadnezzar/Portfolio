                <p>
                    Factoring represents a financing instrument aimed to replenish working assets, which allows a
                    seller and a buyer to conclude a contract for goods supply or service provision with a payment delay or on condition of payment for the goods supplied upon their sale, thus making it possible for the seller to have advance proceeds while protecting itself against non-payment risk and securing payment collection within the term of the contract or after its expiry and having receivables accounted. Analysis of the recent years shows a clear trend of business switching from working capital loans given by banks to factoring services, due to interest rates convergence. The growing demand for factoring financing is facilitated by increasing penetration of electronic document circulation into operations of claim assignment-based financing through development of both multifactor platforms for electronic document flow and on-line market places for liability assignment.

                <p>
                    Cost of service and financing amount depend on provisions of contract under which monetary claims are assigned, as well as on background of relationship between the parties to the contract, their solvability and reputation.
